# Typing In Chat Plugin
Enable you server to show when players actively typing in chat.
Server admins should install plugin on their server. Everyone who install [client-side mod](https://github.com/Orphey98/TypingInChat-Mod) will have special indication while they are typing in chat. <br>
Players who do not have client-side mod will only see other player's indicators and will not have their own. 


## Features

- Animated and highly customizable
- Permissions support to show or hide indication for specific users
- Visible for players that don't have clientside mod
- Based on packets and text-display entities


## Installation

You need to put typinginchat-spigot.jar into server plugins folder. Also, you need to have [packetevents 2.6.0](https://github.com/retrooper/packetevents/releases/tag/v2.6.0) and [HologramAPI 1.4.7](https://github.com/max1mde/HologramAPI/releases/tag/1.4.7) installed.
You may change TIC indicators appearance with config.yml.
